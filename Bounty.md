### Experiences

#### Positive
- While Ethereum has a large ecosystem, I always perceived it as monopolistic and exclusive. This is especially due to wallets like MetaMask which restricts you to operate within a specified chain, thereby often limiting the creative scope while developing a product. Discovering **Axelar** made me realize that many of the things I had imagined were technically possible. I often felt bad for telling our product owners that certain features weren't feasible, but now I'm excited to collaborate with them and develop even more exciting features.

#### Negative
- Given the rapid pace of technology development, there were frequent package updates. This led to situations where the demos in the 'examples' repository or tutorials conducted within the past three months didn't work properly due to package version issues. These hitches can be really annoying during development, and I hope they consider a comprehensive update soon.

- What I found puzzling was that their most representative 'example' site merely has codes without an actual interactive webpage to test and experience the functionalities. I genuinely hope they address this and develop a functioning page soon.
